What is this project?
This project is a like a 2d sandbox pixel game in which you can spawn in elements that have their own unique movement and interactions.
So far the game has these elements: air, fire, smoke, steam, molten rock, water, dust, embers, sand, soil, grass, stone, and wood.
Each of these elements can interact with others based on movement and temperature that cause it to turn into a gas or a liquid.
The goal of this game is up to your imagination and to play around with these elements.
Future plans for this game is to continue adding more elements such as TNT, acid, acid rain, trees, etc. But the main goal would be to refine the current ones and have more interactions between them. I also plan to add character movement and npc's into the game through rigid bodies which will take a process but is definitely achievable

What graphics-based technologies it is based upon
This project's idea was based upon other games like power toy and noita. While coming up with the idea for this game I found the a suitable 2d engine, Pixijs which can handle what I need to do for this project. Using this engine is pretty simple to do in terms of drawing rectangles and filling in the color. Other than that the rest was my side developing the logic and the shading and coloring.
